            Cruel Summer<br> <br>
            Fever dream high in the quiet of the night<br>
You know that I caught it<br>
Bad, bad boy<br>
Shiny toy with a price<br>
You know that I bought it<br>
Killing me slow, out the window<br>
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below<br>
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes<br>
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more<br>
And it's new, the shape of your body<br>
It's blue, the feeling I've got<br>
And it's ooh, whoa, oh<br>
It's a cruel summer<br>
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em<br>
No rules in breakable heaven<br>
But ooh, whoa oh<br>
It's a cruel summer<br>
With you<br>
Hang your head low<br>
In the glow of the vending machine<br>
I'm not dying<br>
You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times<br>
We're not trying<br>
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife<br>
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone<br>
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes<br>
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know<br>
Oh, it's new, the shape of your body<br>
It's blue, the feeling I've got<br>
And it's ooh, whoa, oh<br>
It's a cruel summer<br>
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em<br>
No rules in breakable heaven<br>
But ooh, whoa, oh<br>
It's a cruel summer<br>
With you<br>
I'm drunk in the back of the car<br>
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)<br>
Said, "I'm fine, " but it wasn't true<br>
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you<br>
And I snuck in through the garden gate<br>
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (oh)<br>
And I screamed for whatever it's worth<br>
"I love you, " ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?<br>
He looks up grinning like a devil<br>
It's new, the shape of your body<br>
It's blue, the feeling I've got<br>
And it's ooh, whoa, oh<br>
It's a cruel summer<br>
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em<br>
No rules, in breakable heaven<br>
But ooh, whoa, oh<br>
It's a cruel summer<br>
With you<br>
I'm drunk in the back of the car<br>
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)<br>
Said, "I'm fine, " but it wasn't true<br>
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you<br>
And I snuck in through the garden gate<br>
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (oh)<br>
And I screamed for whatever it's worth<br>
"I love you, " ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?<br>

            Enchanted<br> <br>
            There I was again tonight<br>
Forcing laughter, faking smiles<br>
Same old tired, lonely place<br>
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy<br>
Vanished when I saw your face<br>
All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you<br>
Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"<br>
'Cross the room your silhouette<br>
Starts to make its way to me<br>
The playful conversation starts<br>
Counter all your quick remarks<br>
Like passing notes in secrecy<br>
And it was enchanting to meet you<br>
All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you<br>
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go<br>
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home<br>
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br>
I was enchanted to meet you<br>
The lingering question kept me up<br>
2 AM, who do you love?<br>
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake<br>
And now I'm pacing back and forth<br>
Wishing you were at my door<br>
I'd open up and you would say, "Hey"<br>
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is, I was enchanted to meet you<br>
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go<br>
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home<br>
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br>
That this night is flawless, don't you let it go<br>
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone<br>
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br>
I was enchanted to meet you<br>
This is me praying that<br>
This was the very first page<br>
Not where the story line ends<br>
My thoughts will echo your name, until I see you again<br>
These are the words I held back, as I was leaving too soon<br>
I was enchanted to meet you<br>
Please don't be in love with someone else<br>
Please don't have somebody waiting on you<br>
Please don't be in love with someone else<br>
Please don't have somebody waiting on you<br>
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go<br>
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home<br>
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br>
This night is flawless, don't you let it go<br>
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone<br>
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew<br>
I was enchanted to meet you<br>
Please don't be in love with someone else<br>
Please don't have somebody waiting on you<br>

            Love Story<br> <br>
            We were both young when I first saw you<br>
I close my eyes and the flashback starts<br>
I'm standing there<br>
On a balcony in summer air<br>
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns<br>
See you make your way through the crowd<br>
And say "Hello"<br>
Little did I know<br>
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles<br>
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"<br>
And I was crying on the staircase<br>
Begging you, "Please don't go"<br>
And I said<br>
"Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone<br>
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run<br>
You'll be the prince, and I'll be the princess<br>
It's a love story, baby, just say yes"<br>
So I sneak out to the garden to see you<br>
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew<br>
So close your eyes<br>
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh<br>
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter<br>
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"<br>
But you were everything to me<br>
I was begging you, "Please don't go"<br>
And I said<br>
"Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone<br>
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run<br>
You'll be the prince, and I'll be the princess<br>
It's a love story, baby, just say yes"<br>
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel<br>
This love is difficult, but it's real<br>
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess<br>
It's a love story, baby, just say yes<br>
Oh, oh-oh<br>
I got tired of waiting<br>
Wondering if you were ever coming around<br>
My faith in you was fading<br>
When I met you on the outskirts of town<br>
And I said<br>
"Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone<br>
I keep waiting for you, but you never come<br>
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"<br>
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring<br>
And said<br>
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone<br>
I love you, and that's all I really know<br>
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress<br>
It's a love story, baby, just say yes"<br>
Oh, oh-oh<br>
Oh, oh-oh, oh<br>
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you<br>
